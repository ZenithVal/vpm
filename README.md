This repo hosts my [VPM](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/vpm/)-compatible packages for use with [VCC](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/) or [ALCOM](https://vrc-get.anatawa12.com/alcom/).

## Usage With VCC
### Adding Repo Listing
- With the [VCC](https://vrchat.com/download/vcc) or [ALCOM](https://ask.vrchat.com/t/alcom-a-crossplatform-fast-open-source-unofficial-creator-companion-alternative/24058), go to https://zenithval.github.io/vpm, click `Add to VCC` at the top, and follow the prompts.
- Otherwise, make sure you have the [VPM CLI](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/vpm/cli) installed, then run the command `vpm add repo https://zenithval.github.io/vpm/index.json`.

### Adding Packages to a Project

In the VPM Interface, select your project, locate the `Selected Repos` dropdown, and check `Zenith's VPM Repo`. Then, select the package you want to add, and click the plus button.

## Manual Usage

Each package has its own repository, and usually contains a standalone package distribution, as well as a VPM-compatible package distribution. If you want to use the standalone package, you can download it from the releases page of the package's repository.
